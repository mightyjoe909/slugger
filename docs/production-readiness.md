# Slugger Production Readiness

> This is longer-term product material, not a claim that the organization next MVP is production-ready. The next MVP stops at a validated managed draft PR and canonical result and remains blocked on the gates in [`docs/next-mvp.md`](next-mvp.md#external-dependencies-limitations-and-readiness).

## Canonical execution path

`slugger build` → `full-sdlc-v2` → managed prompts → capability resolver →
ChatGPT planning → Canva design/manual handoff → architecture/ADRs →
Codex coding agent → AppManifest → ProjectMaterializer → IsolatedBuildRunner →
bounded remediation → durable approvals → readiness gate → GitHub draft PR →
draft release candidate
