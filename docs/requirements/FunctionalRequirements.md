# Functional Requirements

## Requirement record convention

Each record is atomic at the product-behavior level. “Input” and “output” identify information, not transport or schema. Priorities: P0 MVP release-blocking; P1 MVP important; P2 post-MVP; P3 candidate. Unless stated otherwise, the precondition is an authorized actor or canonical caller and the postcondition is a durable, correlated outcome.

> **MVP interpretation:** priorities in this historical product baseline do not by themselves select the organization next MVP. The exact included and deferred IDs are defined in [the organization next-MVP contribution](../next-mvp.md#narrow-responsibility-and-requirements).

## A. Intent intake and scope

### FR-INT-01 — Accept complete approved intent
**Description:** Slugger MUST accept a single bounded software intent only when accompanied by the complete canonical `execution-input/v2` object, including contract, task, delivery, correlation, source, target, mode, task type, draft-only policy, and immutable request context required by the pinned schema.
**Rationale:** Execution must remain tied to its governance context. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** external portfolio and control-plane contracts; BR-01–BR-04.  
**Inputs:** canonical execution request. **Outputs:** validated normalized request or rejection reasons. **Preconditions:** supported contract is available. **Postconditions:** accepted fields are bound to the run and immutable-input digest.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-INT-01a:** complete supported input is accepted without losing supplied context. **AC-INT-01b:** each absent, malformed, unsupported, or contradictory mandatory field blocks execution before provider invocation. **AC-INT-01c:** rejection identifies fields and does not mutate a target.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-02, VG-07.

### FR-INT-02 — Authenticate and authorize the admitted caller
**Description:** Slugger SHALL authenticate and authorize the router-admitted caller, require an enabled registered Slugger target, permitted mode/task type, and draft-only policy before execution. Slugger SHALL NOT recheck a live source label or require a second approval record.
**Rationale:** Stale or local signals cannot authorize consequential action. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** Interface-portfolio-tasks; Interface-organization-github.  
**Inputs:** authenticated routed request and local policy. **Outputs:** authorization decision/evidence. **Preconditions:** request passed structural validation. **Postconditions:** unauthorized work has no generation or target mutation.
**Acceptance:** **AC-INT-02a:** unauthorized caller blocks locally before execution; router-owned disabled activation prevents dispatch. **AC-INT-02b:** `ai-sdlc-approved`, another label, and a second target approval are neither required nor authoritative. **AC-INT-02c:** verification mode causes no provider call or repository mutation.
**Vision:** VG-03, VG-07.

### FR-SCP-01 — Bound and communicate supported scope
**Description:** Slugger MUST evaluate intent against the supported project-class catalog and disclose accepted constraints, promised checks, exclusions, and residual human responsibilities before generation.  
**Rationale:** Users must not mistake a narrow proof for broad product support. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-CAT-01.  
**Inputs:** intent, project class, catalog version. **Outputs:** scope decision and scope declaration. **Preconditions:** authorized request. **Postconditions:** only supported, bounded work proceeds.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-SCP-01a:** MVP accepts only the governed dependency-minimal Python CLI class. **AC-SCP-01b:** unsupported or unbounded intent is rejected with unmet constraints. **AC-SCP-01c:** the run evidence states what validation does and does not establish.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-03.

### FR-CAT-01 — Govern supported capability catalog
**Description:** Slugger SHALL expose an identifiable catalog of supported project classes, templates/capabilities, required inputs, promised outputs, validation profile, and lifecycle status; experimental entries MUST NOT be represented as supported.  
**Rationale:** Capability claims require a controlled source. **Priority:** P1. **Dependencies:** BR-20.  
**Inputs:** approved catalog release. **Outputs:** queryable/readable catalog identity. **Preconditions:** product release selected. **Postconditions:** run references exact applicable entry.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-CAT-01a:** catalog distinguishes supported, deprecated, and experimental. **AC-CAT-01b:** an unknown identifier fails closed. **AC-CAT-01c:** evidence records catalog entry/version.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-06.

## B. Run control, prompt, and provider

### FR-RUN-01 — Establish stable run and delivery identity
**Description:** Slugger MUST create a unique run identity and bind it to the contract-defined stable logical delivery identity, correlation identity, source, target, base, requested branch, and immutable-input digest. Runtime attempt IDs MUST NOT replace logical identity.  
**Rationale:** Audit and idempotency require stable correlation. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** canonical contract.  
**Inputs:** validated request. **Outputs:** durable run record. **Preconditions:** request authorized. **Postconditions:** identity bindings cannot silently change.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-RUN-01a:** redelivery preserves delivery ownership while each attempt remains distinguishable. **AC-RUN-01b:** conflicting immutable input under one delivery ID blocks. **AC-RUN-01c:** all artifacts/events correlate to the run and delivery.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-05.

### FR-RUN-02 — Persist lifecycle state
**Description:** Slugger SHALL durably record phase status, timestamps, decisions, safe errors, evidence references, output references, retry lineage, and terminal outcome at every boundary.  
**Rationale:** Operators need recovery after interruption. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** NFR-REL-03, NFR-OBS-01.  
**Inputs:** lifecycle events. **Outputs:** ordered state history. **Preconditions:** run exists. **Postconditions:** latest valid state is recoverable.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-RUN-02a:** interruption at each boundary retains the last completed phase. **AC-RUN-02b:** invalid state transition is blocked/audited. **AC-RUN-02c:** terminal success, failure, blocked, and cancelled outcomes are distinguishable where contract permits.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-05.

### FR-PRM-01 — Construct reproducible generation request
**Description:** Slugger MUST transform bounded intent into a constrained provider request using an identifiable prompt/policy version, preserving source intent, normalized inputs, constraints, requested output location, and provenance.  
**Rationale:** Reproducibility and review require knowing what was requested. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-SCP-01.  
**Inputs:** bounded intent, catalog entry, prompt policy. **Outputs:** provider-neutral request and digest. **Preconditions:** workspace ready. **Postconditions:** immutable request evidence retained subject to retention policy.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-PRM-01a:** same normalized immutable inputs and versions yield the same request digest. **AC-PRM-01b:** user content cannot override system safety/publication policy. **AC-PRM-01c:** secrets are absent/redacted from retained prompt evidence.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-04.

### FR-PRV-01 — Execute through a bounded provider interface
**Description:** Slugger SHALL invoke an approved generation provider only inside the assigned workspace, with phase-scoped capabilities, bounded resources, allowlisted context, and no publication authority. It MUST capture provider identity/version where available, session/correlation data, result category, and bounded diagnostics.  
**Rationale:** Provider behavior must remain subordinate to product policy. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** Interface-ai-generation-provider; FR-WS-01.  
**Inputs:** provider-neutral request and workspace authorization. **Outputs:** candidate files and provider execution evidence. **Preconditions:** authorized implement mode. **Postconditions:** provider completion does not imply validation.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-PRV-01a:** unavailable/failed provider produces a failed phase, preserved safe evidence, and no fallback presented as provider output. **AC-PRV-01b:** attempted writes outside workspace are blocked. **AC-PRV-01c:** provider never receives target publication credential.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-04, VG-06.

## C. Isolation and generated output

### FR-WS-01 — Create isolated run workspace
**Description:** Slugger MUST create a run-specific generated-project workspace outside Slugger source, installed package locations, target production checkout, and other runs; it SHALL verify containment before use.  
**Rationale:** Generation must not corrupt trusted source. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** NFR-SEC-02.  
**Inputs:** run identity and configured runtime location. **Outputs:** verified workspace reference. **Preconditions:** valid writable approved storage. **Postconditions:** generated activity is contained.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-WS-01a:** repository-root, source-subtree, absolute/traversal, and escaping-link workspaces are rejected. **AC-WS-01b:** concurrent runs cannot share writable workspace state. **AC-WS-01c:** source integrity check detects any mutation.  
**Vision:** VG-04.

### FR-WS-02 — Govern workspace retention and cleanup
**Description:** Slugger SHALL preserve or remove workspaces according to configured, disclosed retention policy; cleanup MUST verify ownership and MUST NOT follow links or remove unowned paths.  
**Rationale:** Evidence needs must be balanced with security and storage. **Priority:** P1. **Dependencies:** NFR-CFG-01; NFR-CMP-02.  
**Inputs:** terminal state, retention policy, ownership metadata. **Outputs:** retention/cleanup record. **Preconditions:** workspace ownership provable. **Postconditions:** policy applied without affecting other data.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-WS-02a:** failure evidence is available for configured diagnostic period. **AC-WS-02b:** ambiguous ownership blocks deletion. **AC-WS-02c:** cleanup is auditable.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-04.

### FR-ART-01 — Inventory and protect candidate artifacts
**Description:** Slugger MUST produce a complete generated-file inventory containing normalized relative identity, type, size, integrity digest, provenance phase, and policy disposition; protected evidence MUST be separated from provider-writable output.  
**Rationale:** Review and tamper detection require a trustworthy bill of generated artifacts. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-WS-01.  
**Inputs:** candidate workspace. **Outputs:** protected manifest and digest. **Preconditions:** provider phase ended. **Postconditions:** downstream phases use the recorded candidate set.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-ART-01a:** added, removed, changed, duplicate-normalized, and escaping paths are detected. **AC-ART-01b:** later candidate mutation invalidates prior evidence. **AC-ART-01c:** manifest cannot be overwritten by generated code.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-04.

## D. Validation and verification

### FR-VAL-01 — Validate output before execution
**Description:** Slugger MUST evaluate every candidate against the selected project's path, file, size, content, language syntax, naming, structure, packaging, dependency, secret, and prohibited-behavior policies before installation or generated execution.  
**Rationale:** Unsafe output must be rejected before it can act. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-CAT-01, FR-ART-01.  
**Inputs:** protected manifest, candidate files, validation profile. **Outputs:** per-check results and aggregate gate. **Preconditions:** stable inventory. **Postconditions:** only passing output may install.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-VAL-01a:** one required failed/error/incomplete check blocks later execution and publication. **AC-VAL-01b:** check evidence identifies policy/version and affected artifact without exposing secrets. **AC-VAL-01c:** symlinks, special files, path ambiguity, embedded credentials, and disallowed dependencies fail closed.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-02, VG-04.

### FR-DEP-01 — Control dependency acquisition
**Description:** Slugger SHALL resolve and acquire only dependencies permitted by the applicable project profile and environment policy, record source/provenance and resolved identity, and fail closed when integrity, availability, or policy cannot be established.  
**Rationale:** Dependencies are an untrusted execution boundary. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-VAL-01; NFR-SEC-04.  
**Inputs:** declared dependencies and approved source policy. **Outputs:** resolution evidence or rejection. **Preconditions:** validation passed. **Postconditions:** only admitted dependencies enter execution environment.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-DEP-01a:** undeclared/disallowed sources and dependencies block. **AC-DEP-01b:** resolution is bounded and recorded. **AC-DEP-01c:** dependency failure cannot be reported as a project test failure or success.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-04.

### FR-EXE-01 — Install and execute in controlled isolation
**Description:** Slugger MUST install and run generated software in a fresh project-specific environment separated from Slugger, other runs, credentials, and protected host resources, with bounded time, output, processes, storage, and network access according to policy.  
**Rationale:** Candidate code is untrusted. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-DEP-01; NFR-SEC-02.  
**Inputs:** validated candidate and admitted dependencies. **Outputs:** installation/execution evidence. **Preconditions:** all pre-execution gates pass. **Postconditions:** environment cannot be promoted or reused as trusted production state.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-EXE-01a:** generated processes cannot access publication secrets or Slugger state. **AC-EXE-01b:** limit violation terminates the phase and blocks publication. **AC-EXE-01c:** installation result is distinct from test/smoke results.  
**Vision:** VG-04.

### FR-TST-01 — Execute bounded automated tests
**Description:** Slugger SHALL discover/select tests according to the project-class profile, execute them in isolation, and retain commands/criteria, environment identity, duration, exit category, bounded output, and test counts where available.  
**Rationale:** Reviewers require observed behavioral evidence. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-EXE-01.  
**Inputs:** installed candidate, test profile. **Outputs:** test evidence and gate. **Preconditions:** installation passed. **Postconditions:** a required test failure blocks publication.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-TST-01a:** no required tests, test failure, timeout, crash, or ambiguous runner result fails the required gate. **AC-TST-01b:** generated claims cannot substitute for observed result. **AC-TST-01c:** evidence distinguishes pass/fail/error/not-run.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-02.

### FR-SMK-01 — Perform deterministic smoke verification
**Description:** Slugger MUST execute the project-class minimum promised behavior using predefined, non-interactive inputs and compare exit behavior and normalized observable output with explicit expectations.  
**Rationale:** Tests alone do not establish that the delivered interface starts and responds. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-TST-01.  
**Inputs:** installed candidate and smoke profile. **Outputs:** invocation, expected/observed comparison, gate result. **Preconditions:** required tests pass. **Postconditions:** mismatch blocks publication.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-SMK-01a:** repeated checks in equivalent declared environments produce the same normalized verdict. **AC-SMK-01b:** timeout, prompt-for-input, unexpected side effect, exit mismatch, or output mismatch fails. **AC-SMK-01c:** scope of proven behavior is stated.  
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-02, VG-05.

### FR-EVD-01 — Assemble review evidence
**Description:** Slugger SHALL assemble an integrity-protected evidence package linking approved input, scope, identities, prompt provenance, artifact manifest, provider result, every gate, environment, status history, publication, known exclusions, and residual human decisions.  
**Rationale:** Evidence is the product's basis for trust. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** all run phases.  
**Inputs:** phase records. **Outputs:** human-readable summary and machine-readable evidence. **Preconditions:** terminal or blocked point reached. **Postconditions:** facts, claims, failures, skipped checks, and unknowns remain distinguishable.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-EVD-01a:** integrity alteration is detectable. **AC-EVD-01b:** summary links each claim to observed evidence. **AC-EVD-01c:** secrets/sensitive values are excluded or redacted. **AC-EVD-01d:** partial runs produce truthful partial evidence, never a passing aggregate.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-03.

## E. Publication, retry, and recovery

### FR-PUB-01 — Gate publication
**Description:** Slugger MUST permit publication only for an authorized implement request whose required validation, dependency, installation, test, smoke, manifest-integrity, source-integrity, and target-preflight gates all pass and whose evidence remains current.  
**Rationale:** Publication is consequential. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-EVD-01; BR-11.  
**Inputs:** gate/evidence set, unchanged admitted input, and current local policy. **Outputs:** publication authorization decision. **Preconditions:** candidate is stable. **Postconditions:** any ambiguity/failed/incomplete/stale gate blocks mutation.
**Acceptance:** **AC-PUB-01a:** a fault injected into each gate independently yields no push or PR creation/update. **AC-PUB-01b:** changed input binding or local-policy denial before mutation blocks without a live source-approval lookup. **AC-PUB-01c:** successful decision records exact evidence digest.
**Vision:** VG-01, VG-03, VG-04.

### FR-PUB-02 — Publish one managed draft review
**Description:** Slugger SHALL publish only inventoried verified files and review evidence to the contract-defined deterministic branch/base and create or update at most one demonstrably Slugger-owned open draft pull request per logical delivery. It SHALL NOT approve, mark ready, merge, release, deploy, or close work.  
**Rationale:** A draft PR is the automation/human boundary. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** Interface-github-platform; target interface.  
**Inputs:** authorized publication, target, branch, verified artifacts, ownership marker. **Outputs:** branch/commit/draft PR references. **Preconditions:** ownership and permissions unambiguous. **Postconditions:** target contains a reviewable draft tied to evidence.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-PUB-02a:** PR is draft and identifies source/delivery/correlation, scope, checks, evidence and human next steps. **AC-PUB-02b:** unverified/stale/provider-control files are absent. **AC-PUB-02c:** automation cannot merge or approve. **AC-PUB-02d:** target changes are limited to the owned branch/draft.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-03, VG-07.

### FR-IDM-01 — Make redelivery and publication idempotent
**Description:** Slugger MUST classify durable target state before provider invocation and before publication. Completed matching delivery SHALL be reused with canonical `duplicate-reused`; changed payload under the delivery ID SHALL be rejected; an absent delivery MAY proceed; conflicting, ambiguous, unowned, non-draft, closed/merged, wrong-base, or multiply matching state MUST be preserved and fail closed.
**Rationale:** At-least-once delivery must not duplicate or overwrite work. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** FR-RUN-01, FR-PUB-02.  
**Inputs:** `delivery_id`, immutable payload digest, expected ownership marker and target state. **Outputs:** proceed/reuse/block classification. **Preconditions:** read access to target. **Postconditions:** no guessing or destructive reconciliation.
**Acceptance:** **AC-IDM-01a:** sequential and concurrent identical deliveries result in at most one managed open draft. **AC-IDM-01b:** completed matching delivery does not reinvoke provider. **AC-IDM-01c:** every unsafe state is unchanged and accompanied by recovery guidance. **AC-IDM-01d:** runtime IDs/timestamps/randomness do not determine ownership.  
**Vision:** VG-05.

### FR-REC-01 — Resume or retry safely
**Description:** Slugger SHALL support policy-permitted resume/retry from the last trustworthy boundary, revalidate mutable authority, environment, artifact integrity, and target state, and rerun any stale dependent checks.  
**Rationale:** Recovery must not bypass gates. **Priority:** P1. **Dependencies:** FR-RUN-02, FR-IDM-01.  
**Inputs:** run/delivery identity and recovery request. **Outputs:** resumed attempt or actionable refusal. **Preconditions:** retained state is readable and ownership proven. **Postconditions:** retry lineage and revalidation recorded.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-REC-01a:** interruption scenarios resume without treating partial phase as passed. **AC-REC-01b:** changed candidate invalidates downstream evidence. **AC-REC-01c:** irrecoverable/ambiguous state is preserved for human action.  
**Vision:** VG-05.

### FR-ERR-01 — Provide actionable failure outcomes
**Description:** Every rejected, failed, timed-out, blocked, or interrupted phase SHALL produce a safe categorized outcome with phase, cause, impact, retryability, evidence location, and authorized next action; internal/provider assertions MUST NOT be exposed as verified facts.  
**Rationale:** Users need recovery without unsafe bypasses. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** NFR-OBS-*.  
**Inputs:** exception, timeout, validation failure, external failure. **Outputs:** safe failure record and user summary. **Preconditions:** run or intake attempt exists. **Postconditions:** publication remains blocked unless all gates later pass.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-ERR-01a:** representative failures yield distinct category and next step. **AC-ERR-01b:** secrets and unsafe raw content are not disclosed. **AC-ERR-01c:** no failure is represented as success or production readiness.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-05.

## F. Organization contract and continuous conformance

### FR-RES-01 — Produce and expose the canonical execution result
**Description:** Slugger MUST map every terminal, rejected, failed, reused, no-change, interrupted, or ambiguous local observation to the pinned organization-owned execution-result contract, validate it with the official validator, durably retain it, and send it through the pinned organization result receiver with at-least-once-safe identity. Slugger SHALL NOT define substitute schema or status semantics.
**Rationale:** Routing is incomplete without a truthful, correlated, interoperable outcome. **Priority:** organization next-MVP P0. **Dependencies:** pinned result contract and canonical receiver; FR-RUN-01; FR-EVD-01.
**Acceptance:** **AC-RES-01a:** verify success, implement success, existing-draft reuse, no change, authorization rejection, contract rejection, execution failure, validation failure, publication failure, and ambiguous/interrupted execution each produce a validator-accepted result. **AC-RES-01b:** required version; delivery, correlation and target identities; canonical status; validation evidence; applicable draft metadata; safe error; timestamps; and retry/reconciliation guidance survive mapping. **AC-RES-01c:** unknown required status/field or uncertain result delivery fails closed and is reconciled without changing execution truth or duplicating a visible effect.

### FR-CNF-01 — Continuously prove target-interface conformance
**Description:** Slugger MUST provide a deterministic, merge-blocking, no-Codex CI suite against immutably pinned organization fixtures and official validators, using fakes for authority, executor, repository, publication, clock, and result delivery.
**Rationale:** Interface drift must be found without credentials or organization mutations. **Priority:** organization next-MVP P0. **Dependencies:** shared fixture release and pinning decision.
**Acceptance:** **AC-CNF-01a:** valid verify and fake implement; wrong target and router-side disabled-target nondispatch; unsupported version; malformed input; unauthorized caller; unsupported task type; invalid concurrency group; duplicate/conflicting delivery; matching/ambiguous/racing draft; fake Codex, validation, test, and publication failures; canonical result; receiver failure; and identical/conflicting result redelivery are exercised. **AC-CNF-01b:** Codex credentials are absent, Codex network calls are trapped, and no real branch/commit/push/PR is created. **AC-CNF-01c:** fixture/validator incompatibility fails the required check and blocks merge; local fixtures cannot redefine canonical semantics.

## G. Human governance and lifecycle evolution

### FR-GOV-01 — Preserve human decision gates
**Description:** Slugger SHALL identify the accountable human role and required decision at intent approval, material scope/architecture exception, security disposition, draft review, merge, release, deployment, and production use; it MUST NOT self-satisfy those gates.  
**Rationale:** AI augments rather than replaces accountable judgment. **Priority:** P0. **Dependencies:** BR-01, BR-14.  
**Inputs:** governance state and evidence. **Outputs:** pending/recorded decision reference. **Preconditions:** applicable lifecycle point. **Postconditions:** consequential progression requires external human decision.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-GOV-01a:** generated/provider content cannot create valid human approval. **AC-GOV-01b:** evidence names outstanding decisions. **AC-GOV-01c:** merge/release/deployment are never performed by Slugger automation.  
**Vision:** VG-03.

### FR-LCM-01 — Manage lifecycle artifacts (post-MVP)
**Description:** Slugger SHALL identify, version, relate, review-state, retain, and hand off professional lifecycle artifacts with provenance and explicit upstream/downstream traceability.  
**Rationale:** Long-term value requires fidelity across phases. **Priority:** P2. **Dependencies:** approved phase-specific requirements.  
**Inputs:** approved artifact and predecessor references. **Outputs:** versioned artifact, relationships, review state. **Preconditions:** capability has passed promotion. **Postconditions:** supersession never erases history.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-LCM-01a:** each artifact identifies origin, version, status, owner, inputs and successors. **AC-LCM-01b:** changed upstream artifact identifies potentially impacted downstream artifacts. **AC-LCM-01c:** unapproved draft is not treated as approved phase input.  
**Vision:** VG-02, VG-06.

### FR-LCM-02 — Compose bounded lifecycle capabilities (post-MVP)
**Description:** Each promoted lifecycle capability SHALL declare versioned inputs, outputs, validation, evidence, authority, failure behavior, compatibility, pause/resume semantics, and named human review point; orchestration MUST permit independent replacement and MUST NOT grant unrestricted autonomous authority.  
**Rationale:** Safe expansion requires explicit seams. **Priority:** P2. **Dependencies:** FR-LCM-01, BR-20.  
**Inputs:** approved capability definitions and artifacts. **Outputs:** governed phase result. **Preconditions:** compatibility and required approval satisfied. **Postconditions:** result is independently reviewable.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-LCM-02a:** missing/incompatible input blocks only dependent phase. **AC-LCM-02b:** phase can be paused, resumed, replaced, and independently audited. **AC-LCM-02c:** no composition bypasses review gates.  
**Vision:** VG-03, VG-06.

### FR-EXT-01 — Support replaceable providers/extensions
**Description:** Slugger SHALL evaluate a provider or extension against a provider-neutral capability contract covering inputs, outputs, errors, evidence, security, resource controls, and compatibility before activation; extensions MUST NOT override product policy or human authority.  
**Rationale:** Product semantics must not depend on one vendor. **Priority:** P2 (contract is P1). **Dependencies:** NFR-INT-01.  
**Inputs:** capability declaration and conformance evidence. **Outputs:** approved/unsupported decision. **Preconditions:** extension is identifiable/versioned. **Postconditions:** run records selected provider/capability.  
**Acceptance:** **AC-EXT-01a:** missing mandatory capability yields preflight rejection. **AC-EXT-01b:** equivalent result/error/evidence semantics are testable with a substitute. **AC-EXT-01c:** extension cannot receive broader authority than phase requires.  
**Vision:** VG-04, VG-06.
