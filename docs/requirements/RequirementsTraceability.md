# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Organization next-MVP release trace

The authoritative local selection is the exact ID list in [`docs/next-mvp.md`](../next-mvp.md#narrow-responsibility-and-requirements). Its included requirements trace to the architecture and conformance groups in [`ArchitectureTraceability.md`](../architecture/ArchitectureTraceability.md#organization-next-mvp-slice). Included IDs are **FR-INT-01, FR-INT-02, FR-CAT-01, FR-RUN-01, FR-WS-01, FR-PRV-01, FR-ART-01, FR-VAL-01, FR-DEP-01, FR-EXE-01, FR-TST-01, FR-SMK-01, FR-EVD-01, FR-PUB-01, FR-PUB-02, FR-IDM-01, FR-ERR-01, FR-RES-01, and FR-CNF-01**. Deferred IDs are **FR-SCP-01, FR-RUN-02, FR-PRM-01, FR-WS-02, FR-REC-01, FR-GOV-01, FR-LCM-01, FR-LCM-02, and FR-EXT-01**, regardless of older P0/P1 labels.

The corresponding next-MVP test plan is: valid verify and fake implement; wrong target or router-side disabled-target nondispatch; unsupported version; malformed input; unauthorized caller; unsupported task type; invalid concurrency group; duplicate or conflicting delivery; matching/ambiguous/racing managed draft; fake Codex, validation, test, or publication failure; canonical result; receiver failure; identical/conflicting result redelivery; and proof of no Codex network call, real branch, or real PR. `TC-MVP-CI-001` supplies the authoritative executable inputs and expected results; local policy tests extend but do not redefine that conformance oracle.

## Traceability convention

This matrix provides planning-level coverage from vision goal to future verification. Detailed `AC-*` text is authoritative in [FunctionalRequirements.md](FunctionalRequirements.md); measurable quality criteria are in [NonFunctionalRequirements.md](NonFunctionalRequirements.md). Future test case IDs (`FTC-*`) are test-design placeholders, not implementation prescriptions.

## Coverage governance

Before release, test management SHALL refine placeholders into owned test specifications with environment, fixtures, preconditions, expected results and retained evidence. A report SHALL show 100% P0/P1 requirement and rule coverage. Any human-only check requires rationale and accountable sign-off; no P0 negative/fail-closed path may remain human-only.
